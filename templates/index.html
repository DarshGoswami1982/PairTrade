        <h2>Key Terms</h2>
        <h3>Pair Trading</h3>
        <p>
            Pair trading is a trading strategy that involves matching a long position with a short position in two
            correlated stocks. The idea is to profit from the relative performance of the two stocks rather than the
            overall direction of the market.
        </p>
        <h3>Spread Difference</h3>
        <p>
            The spread difference is the difference in prices between the two stocks in a pair trade. It represents the
            relative value of one stock compared to the other. Traders look for deviations from the historical spread
            difference to identify potential trading opportunities.
        </p>
        <h3>Z-Score</h3>
        <p>
            The z-score is a statistical measure that quantifies how far a data point is from the mean of a data set,
            measured in terms of standard deviations. In pair trading, the z-score is used to determine whether the spread
            difference between two stocks is statistically significant. A high z-score indicates that the spread difference
            is likely to revert to its mean, presenting a trading opportunity.
        </p>
        <h2>Trading Strategy</h2>
        <p>
            To trade using pair trading and the spread difference, traders typically follow these steps:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Identify a pair of correlated stocks.</li>
            <li>Calculate the spread difference between the two stocks.</li>
            <li>Calculate the z-score of the spread difference.</li>
            <li>Enter a long position on the underperforming stock and a short position on the outperforming stock when
                the z-score is high (indicating that the spread difference is likely to revert to its mean).</li>
            <li>Exit the positions when the spread difference returns to its historical average.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            By following this strategy, traders aim to profit from the relative movements of the two stocks while minimizing
            exposure to overall market risk.
        </p>
